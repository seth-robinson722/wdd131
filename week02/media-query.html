            <h2>1 Nephi 1:1</h2>
            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and
            having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my
            days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my
            proceedings in my days.</p>

            <h2>1 Nephi 1:20</h2>
            <p>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast
            out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show
            unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make
            them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.</p>
